# Hangman
## Introduction
Simple hangman game.

![Preview (Spanish)](https://github.com/angelaconde/hangman/blob/master/preview01.png)

My first javascript project for an assigment.

No backend, the word lists are stored as constants. 

## How to Play
1. You can choose a category from the following options:
   - Anything (selected by default)
   - Animals
   - Cities
   - Colours
2. Hit the PLAY button.
3. The letter buttons will be enabled now and you can click the ones you want to try:
    - If the letter is correct it will we written in all its positions in the word mask.
    - If the letter is incorrect you'll lose a life, the lives counter will decrease and a body part will be added to the stickman.
4. The game ends when:
    - You correctly guess the whole word.
    - You lose all lives.

## Changing the language
The game starts by default in Spanish, you can change it to English any time except in the middle of guessing a word.
